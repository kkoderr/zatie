What does the term ‘Bias’ refer to with respect to Machine Learning models and what can it lead to? *

Bias is used to refer to a situation where machine learning algorithms produce results that are  one-sided because of some misconceptions during their development. Machine Learning bias often occurs due to lack of scope or breadth in the data used, and lack of quality and adequate quantity of those data.


 which produces those results.
